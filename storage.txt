Here are some notes summarizing the information on RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5:

RAID Levels

    RAID 0 (Striping):
        Focus: Speed
        How it works: Data split across multiple drives.
        Pros: Fastest read/write speeds.
        Cons: No fault tolerance (data loss if one drive fails).
        Use Cases: Gaming, video editing.

    RAID 1 (Mirroring):
        Focus: Data protection
        How it works: Identical data on two or more drives.
        Pros: High fault tolerance (one drive failure).
        Cons: Slower write speeds.
        Use Cases: Servers, workstations, critical data.

    RAID 5 (Striping with Parity):
        Focus: Balance of speed and protection
        How it works: Data striped, parity info distributed across drives.
        Pros: Good read/write speeds, can handle one drive failure.
        Cons: Slightly less space efficient than RAID 0.
        Use Cases: Servers, workstations, NAS devices.

Key Considerations:

    RAID 0: Fastest, but no redundancy.
    RAID 1: Best for data protection, but slower writes.
    RAID 5: Good balance of speed and protection.
